"""
Red-team tests for the end-of-call JSON-leak bug.

Background: a tester saw the agent speak a literal JSON object at call
wrap-up ('JSON Object to populate the job posting: ```json { "company":
"Slay School", ... }```'). Root cause: SYSTEM_PROMPT mentioned a
post-call "emit a JSON object matching the schema" step. Llama 3.1 8B
(small, weak instruction-follower) treated it as a live-turn directive
and dumped the schema.

These tests guard against regressions:

  Tier 1 (always runs) — static asserts the SYSTEM_PROMPT strings do
    NOT contain the trigger words ("json", "schema", "extraction",
    "ProfileExtraction", "JobExtraction", "invoked once more"). Even
    negative phrasings ("don't output JSON") sometimes get inverted
    by weak models — the safest fix is to remove the words entirely.

  Tier 2 (skipped without CEREBRAS_API_KEY) — live red-team. Spins up
    Cerebras gpt-oss-120b (the same model the agent uses), runs three
    adversarial wrap-up scenarios, and asserts the response contains
    none of: ```json fences, schema-property snippets, or balanced
    `{ "x": ... }` blobs.

Run all:
    cd apps/agent && pytest tests/test_prompt_jsonleak.py -v

Run just live tier:
    CEREBRAS_API_KEY=... pytest tests/test_prompt_jsonleak.py::test_live_redteam -v
